# 2019-10-practical-reproducible-analysis

This repository contains the files for the presentation given by [Alex Dolphin](https://github.com/thecasper2) at the [Düsseldorf R User Group Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Dusseldorf-R-User-Group/) on 17/10/2019

## Presentation abstract

Slides from Alex’s talk "Practical reproducibility of analyses"

In the pursuit of robust, reproducible, and extendable analyses, one key aspect frequently gets overlooked: practicality. Reproducible analyses with a potential for good review are often cumbersome to write: they may require branches to be pulled, environments to be built, and variables to be changed in a well-hidden file. I will propose a step towards greater practicality with an example using three technologies many data scientists know to some extent:

- RMarkdown  
- R shiny server  
- Docker  

By presenting this concept I hope to demonstrate that it is possible for:

- data scientists to review the live code with one link to a shiny-rendered page  
- non-data-scientists to rerun and extend the analysis through an intuitive GUI  
- the data scientist doing the task to achieve this only writing one file in their preferred coding language  

## Links

The presentation contains 4 links. Unfortunately:

- One of these refers to the shiny server running on my local machine, and will not work
- The other three refer to locations inside the trivago network, and unfortunately will not work for those not connected to the network.

Two of these links are trivago-internal repositories, and unfortunately the code cannot be made public at this time.

## Getting more info

As the presentation doesn't offer much practical information without the repositories, you can get in touch with me, the presenter, either via:

- [Github: Alex Dolphin](https://github.com/thecasper2)
- [LinkedIn: Alex Dolphin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexdolphin/)

I will be glad to discuss the concept, or general R/data/data science topics.
